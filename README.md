`HttpClient` takes every PSR-18 compliant HTTP Client Adapter like `"php-http/curl-client": "^1.7"`. It is worth noting that `HttpClient` deprecated since version 2.4, use Psr\Http\Client\ClientInterface instead; see https://www.php-fig.org/psr/psr-18/

`AuthenticationProviderInterface` Authentication Provider from `/authentication/provider/*`

`$apiHost` Hashicorp Vault REST Endpoint URL
